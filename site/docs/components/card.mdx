<LargeParagraph>
    Cards can be used to divide and organise interface content for better understandability and readability. When used correctly, Cards can help your users to scan through vast amounts of information quicker.
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles
- **Use Cards sparingly.** While they can drastically improve service's understandability and readibility, overusing them may result in confusing and complex user interfaces.
- **Cards work very well for listing heterogenous content** such as news items, blog posts or upcoming events.
- **Cards can also be used to emphasize important content** such as site CTA (Call To Action).
- Currently HDS offers base Cards which you can use to build custom Cards for your project's needs. For inspiration and guidelines, you can find custom card examples in <Link href="https://share.goabstract.com/e6aa2ebd-1a49-4cb1-90ef-a44a6486c28b" external>HDS Example Custom Components - Abstract collection</Link>.

## Accessibility
- The colour contrast between the Card and its background must comply with <Link href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#contrast-minimum" external>AA Level contrast ratios</Link>. If needed, you may use Card border to increase the Card contrast to its background.

## Usage & variations

### Empty
Currently HDS offers empty base Cards. These and other HDS components can be used to create custom Cards for your project. By default, HDS recommends Cards without border style.

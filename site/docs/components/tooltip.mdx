# Tooltip

<StatusLabel>New</StatusLabel>
<StatusLabel type="alert" style={{marginLeft: 'var(--spacing-xs)'}}>Pre-release</StatusLabel> 

<LargeParagraph>
  Tooltips are used to present context or background information to the user.
</LargeParagraph>

## Principles
- **Tooltip must not be the sole way to provide essential information that the user must know to perform a task (such as inputting a value).** This means Tooltip should display "nice to have" but not essential information.
    - For more information on what elements should be used to present different kinds of information, refer to [HDS Form pattern - Providing instructions guideline](/)
- **Be clear and consise in the Tooltip description.** Keep the description as short as two to three sentences. If longer explanations are needed, provide a link to a separate page.
- HDS Tooltips come in two sizes; Default and Small. Only use the Small variant if the Tooltip text is less than 5 words long. Otherwise you should use the Default size variant.
- HDS Tooltip implementation has automatic placement feature. You may also alter the Tooltip positioning but always remember to test that the Tooltip is fully visible on all screen sizes.

## Accessibility
- Even though HDS Tooltip does not include a visual title, one must be included for screen readers via using `aria-label`. The label can be as simple as "Info" but it can also feature more detailed description such as "More information about filling your personal details".
- If a Tooltip contains a link, always open them to a new window, so that the process of filling the form is not interrupted.
